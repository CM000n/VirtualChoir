Clement Cano, one of the cocreators of the facebook Virtual Choir
Forum group kindly recorded and donated 4 short tracks for a demo of
this software.

# Natus est Nobis - the introit for Christmas Day.

This video including title page and credits page was 100%
automatically created by the Virtual Choir Maker software in less than
10 minutes.

This piece is highly polyphonic so Clem performed 4 precisely timed
claps in the lead in space which the software found and used to
synchronize the tracks.

Often with more homophonic pieces, the software can find an optimized
mutual best fit between all the tracks and you don't need sync claps.

For instrumental music sync claps (taps?) can be difficult to do well
and still be ready to play at the start of the piece, but sync claps
may be needed for most instrumental pieces.
